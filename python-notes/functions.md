## Introduction to Functions

Functions allow you to create instructions to complete a specific set of coding grouped together under the function.

These groups of codes (or blocks of codes) can repeatedly occur at certain moments in your coding without having to create the same code from scratch over and over again. Here are some of the functions you need to be familiar with: 

- `Simple Functions` - These are groups of codes that are grouped together under the simple function, which can be accessed and repeatedly reused. 
- `Functions with Parameters` - These functions behave in a particular way based on the parameters you create.
- `Functions and Variable Scope` - Variables that have specific conditions to be accessible defined as it's scope.
- `Returning Data from Functions` - the return statement (or returning data) to return data to the function's calling code.
- `Signatures and Overloaded Functions` - Two important conditions to ensure the function operates correctly. 

The syntax uses the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function. The
opened and closed parenthesis are also needed. In this case, they are empty.
This means that the function can be called will no additional parameters.

The end of line uses a colon ":" to start the code block. The block contains all the logic that the function performs. All logic code must be indented to the function definition (The Python interpreter can identify the code block from the indentation)
